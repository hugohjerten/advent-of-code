# Advent of Code

## 2022
2022 [Avent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is the year of golang!
(And maybe Rust??).

Check out [2022/go/README.md](./2022/go/README.md) for instructions on how to run the code,

I have not stored the challenge inputs in the repo, but the code expects the input files to be in the `input/` directory, in the format `N.txt`, where `N` is the day in numeric form (example `1.txt`, `2.txt` etc...)
