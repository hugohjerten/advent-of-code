## 2023
2023 started as the year of golang!
But I don't have time to tackle a language I don't know so well.
To finish the assignments, I will switch to python again...

```sh
poetry install

# Eg. run day #4
poetry run python 2023/py/four/main.py
```

## 2022
2022 is the year of golang!
(And maybe Rust??).

Check out [2022/go/README.md](./2022/go/README.md) for instructions on how to run the code,

I have not stored the challenge inputs in the repo, but the code expects the input files to be in the `input/` directory, in the format `N.txt`, where `N` is the day in numeric form (example `1.txt`, `2.txt` etc...)
